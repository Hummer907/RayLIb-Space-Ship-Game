Technologies  used :
Raylib: It's a C library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to work with 2D graphics and input handling. Raylib is used for creating the game's graphics, handling user input, and managing the game loop.
C++ Standard Library: You've utilized several components from the C++ Standard Library, such as std::vector, std::string, std::rand, std::srand, and std::time for managing collections, strings, and random number generation.
